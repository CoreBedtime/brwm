== Prerequisites

WARNING: BRWM requires disabling System Integrity Protection (SIP) and installing Ammonia. This has security implications. Only proceed if you understand the risks.

=== System Requirements

* macOS Ventura (13.0) or later
* Xcode or Xcode Command Line Tools
* Administrator access
* Understanding of security implications

== Quick Installation

=== 1. Disable SIP

For Intel Macs:

1. Restart your Mac and hold kbd:[⌘+R] during boot
2. Open Terminal from Utilities menu
3. Run: `csrutil disable`
4. Restart your Mac

For Apple Silicon Macs:

1. Shut down your Mac completely
2. Press and hold the Power button until "Loading startup options" appears
3. Click "Options" and continue
4. Select a user and enter their password if prompted
5. Open Terminal from Utilities menu
6. Run: `csrutil disable`
7. Click Apple menu and select "Restart"

=== 2. Disable Library Validation

```bash
sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.security.libraryvalidation.plist DisableLibraryValidation -bool true
```

=== 3. Install Ammonia

1. Download Ammonia from https://github.com/CoreBedtime/ammonia/releases[CoreBedtime/ammonia releases]
2. Install according to Ammonia's instructions
3. Restart your Mac

=== 4. Build and Run BRWM

Clone the repository:

[source,bash]
----
git clone git@github.com:aspauldingcode/brwm.git
cd brwm
----

Open in Xcode and build for Universal Binary (aarch64, aarch64e, x86_64). Select "Any Mac" as the build target, then press kbd:[⌘+B]:

[source,text]
----
xed brwm.xcodeproj
----

Alternatively, build a Universal Binary from the command line. This creates a single executable compatible with Apple's signed pointer ABI, Apple Silicon processors (arm64, arm64e), and Intel processors (x86_64):
[source,bash]
----
xcodebuild -project brwm.xcodeproj -scheme brwm build -arch arm64 -arch arm64e -arch x86_64
----

== Default Keybindings

Once BRWM is running, these keybindings are available:

[cols="1,2"]
|===
|Keybinding |Action

|kbd:[⌘+⌥+1] through kbd:[⌘+⌥+9]
|Switch to workspace 1-9

|kbd:[⌘+⌥+H]
|Decrease master window ratio

|kbd:[⌘+⌥+L]
|Increase master window ratio
|===

== Basic Configuration

BRWM uses JavaScript for configuration. The default configuration is in `p8.js`.

=== Example: Custom Keybinding

```javascript
// Add a custom keybinding to move window to next space
addKeybind(49, MODIFIERS.CMD | MODIFIERS.ALT, function() {
    // Space key (49) + Cmd+Alt
    var windows = getWindows();
    if (windows.length > 0) {
        // Move focused window to next space
        // Implementation depends on your needs
    }
});
```

=== Example: Adjust Layout Settings

```javascript
// Modify layout constants
const OUTER_PADDING = 20;    // Padding around screen edges
const WINDOW_GAP = 10;       // Gap between windows
let masterRatio = 0.6;       // Master window ratio (60%)
```

== Troubleshooting

=== BRWM Won't Start

1. Verify SIP is disabled: `csrutil status`
2. Check that Ammonia is properly installed
3. Ensure BRWM is built for your architecture
4. Check console logs for errors

=== Keybindings Not Working

1. Check for conflicts with system shortcuts
2. Verify JavaScript syntax in configuration
3. Restart BRWM to reload configuration

=== Performance Issues

1. Monitor CPU usage in Activity Monitor
2. Check for infinite loops in JavaScript
3. Reduce layout update frequency if needed

== Next Steps

* See the link:Documentation.adoc#_api_reference[API Reference] for the full JavaScript API documentation
* Read the link:Documentation.adoc[complete documentation] for advanced features
* Customize your JavaScript configuration in `p8.js`
* Explore the JavaScript API for automation
* Join the community for support and contributions

== Security Notice

Remember that disabling SIP reduces your system's security. Consider:

* Only use on development/personal machines
* Keep your system updated
* Use strong passwords and FileVault encryption
* Regular system backups
* Monitor for suspicious activity
